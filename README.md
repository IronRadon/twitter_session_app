### Description
This application will create a Twitter app using ActiveRecord and the Twitter API to build a back-end of a Twitter CLI.
This project uses the OAuth gem in a nonstandard way to create access tokens as it doesn't not fully utilize the rails/gems to do so.

The project is still in progress.
